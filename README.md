## Dynamic Slideshow

This allows you add images to a folder in your WWW folder that contains images you would like the see in the slideshow. Currently, this requires over writing the Folder Sensor so that the client can see the files. I am working on a built in method but wanted to get this feature available.

You will need to create a folder in your config directory named `custom_components`, within the custom_components folder you will need to create a `sensor` folder, and within that folder copy the `folder.py` file. 

1. Create a folder in your `config` directory named `custom_components`
2. Create a folder in your `custom_components` named `sensor`
3. Copy the `folder.py` into the `sensor` folder
4. Add the folder sensor to your configuration.yaml file
    ```yaml
    - sensor
        - platform: folder
          folder: /config/www/images
    ```
5. Create a folder in your `WWW` folder named `images`
6. Add your images to this folder
7. Restart Home Assistant
8. Check the sensor.images entity to see if the `fileList` attribute lists your image files
9. Add a card to your ui-lovelace.yaml
    ```yaml
    - type: custom:slideshow-card
      folder: sensor.images
    ```
    * The other configuration variables are still available to use
10. Refresh your Lovelace Frontend

Any files you add to the folder should automatically get added to the slide show


## Installation

1. Copy `slideshow-card.js` to `<config directory>/www/slideshow-card.js`
2. Add this to your Lovelace
   `resources:`

```yaml
  - url: /local/slideshow-card.js
    type: js
```
